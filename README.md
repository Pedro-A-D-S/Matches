1. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Load the dataset into a data analysis tool such as Pandas or R.
- Check the data types, null values, and statistical summaries of each variable.
- Visualize the distribution of each variable using histograms, density plots, and boxplots.
- Investigate relationships between variables using scatterplots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.
- Analyze categorical variables using bar charts, stacked bar charts, and contingency tables.
- Identify interesting patterns and trends in the data, and generate hypotheses to explain them.
- Test these hypotheses using statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.
- Summarize the key findings in a report or presentation, including visualizations and statistical summaries.

Preprocess the data by scaling numerical variables, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.
Select appropriate features using domain knowledge, feature selection algorithms, or feature importance measures.
Train a machine learning model on the training set using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set using the selected evaluation metrics.
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search or random search.
Test the final model on the test set to estimate its performance on new, unseen data.
Interpret the model's predictions using techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values.
Summarize the key findings in a report or presentation, including the performance metrics and insights from the model.
